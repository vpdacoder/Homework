// For each of the following, write which datatypes you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the data structure:

// A light switch that can be either on or off.
    // Booleans - true or false values

    // String
// A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
    // An Array

    // An Array
// A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
    // An Object nested in an Array
// A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.

// TAKE IT EASY

// Make an array that holds all of the colors of the rainbow.
const rainbow = ["red","orange","yellow","green","blue","indigo","violet"];
// Write code that will access "blue" from the rainbow array.
let blue = rainbow[4];
console.log(blue);

Make an object that is called your name and holds the information about your favorite food, a hobby, the name of the town that you live in currently, and your favorite datatype.

Write code that will access your hobby from the object that you just created.
